#### Q: Why can't I get through the checkout process at the last step? {#last-step}

A : If you’re having difficulty check out at the last step when filling your telephone numbers, please uncheck the box saying “Save my information for a faster checkout”.
And the process will go through.

If you want to make the faster checkout work, please follos [these directions here](#faster-checkout)

####Q: ZIP CODE ? and POSTAL CODE? {#zip}
A : We are using a third party system, SQUARE, which is a US based company. Therefore you will see quite a few default settings in US standard, such as asking for a ZIP CODE instead of a POSTAL CODE which we use in Canada.

Please just ignore the different term they are using and go head and fill in your POSTAL CODE in the ZIP CODE fields.

Once you’ve set the country field to CANADA, the form title will actually changed to POSTAL CODE automatically.

A : When you proceed with the checkout process to the fourth section “REVIEW & SUBMIT ORDER”, check the checkbox before “Save my information for a faster checkout” and remember to set the mobile phone number field to “Canada +1” instead of the default “United State +1” .
